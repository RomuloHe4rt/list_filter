# ListFilter

## Challenge 02 - Filtering in lists

> In this challenge, we create a new project with a function that, given a list of strings that represent numbers or not (example [1, 3, 6, 43, "banana", 6 , "abc"]), filter all numeric elements in the list and return how many odd numbers are in that list.
